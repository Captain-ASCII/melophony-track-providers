Melophony - Track Providers
===========================

This is an extension of the Melophony project: see the `Melophony github page <https://github.com/Captain-ASCII/melophony>`_ for more information.

The melophony-track-providers module is used to group every track providers that may be used to fill the Melophony track database.
The main idea of this separate module is to decorrelate the management of the tracks done in Melophony from the way they are added to the database (which is not the goal of this project).
Its architecture has been constructed to allow users that host a Melophony server to add their own provider while being able to update the base Melophony module.
